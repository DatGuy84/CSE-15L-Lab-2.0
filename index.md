## Summary
```
Throughout weeks 2 and 3, I have learned more about servers.  In week two, I learned how
to create a serve along with accessing the query and url info.  Additionally, in week
three, I learned how to create a pair of keys, public and private, that could be used
to sign in with my ieng6 account.
